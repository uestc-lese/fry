As a junior high school student, I began to learn programming. Unfortunately, I had read several junk 
books, such as 21 Days Mastery C++, which were common at that time. It was not a big problem to read them, 
and even to write a little program. But I don't know why the software is out of order. I can't start with 
a slightly huge programming problem, and I can't do anything with the existing libraries. Although I code 
constantly every day, I find myself programmed so slowly that I have only a very limited understanding of 
the concepts of iteration and recursion, so to speak, just using a computer as a calculator.
After entering college, I majored in physics. For the first time, I had been memorizing and reciting the 
physical formulas, but I couldn't understand how they came to be, what they were related to, or what they
meant. I kept learning how to calculate and answer some common physics questions, but I didn't know what 
was behind these houses.
And when I tried to do some computer games based on physical behavior, I had the same problem again: I 
couldn't get started with new problems, the fear of new problems grew, and I began to take the initiative 
to escape, not really understand, but to fantasize about solving problems by copying and pasting code 
through Google search. Fortunately, a class in my sophomore year completely changed my way of learning. It 
was the first time that I had the feeling of "opening my eyes" and I realized painfully that I had only a 
poor real understanding of some subjects, including physics and computer science minors.
About that lesson: We had just finished studying electricity and special relativity. The professor wrote 
down the two subjects on the blackboard and drew a line to connect them. "Suppose we have an electron 
moving along the wire at a relativistic level. At first the professor wrote down the familiar formulas of 
electrical and special relativity, but after the algebraic derivation of several blackboards, the formula 
for the magnetic field magically appeared. Although I knew this formula a few years ago, I had no idea 
there was such a potential connection between these phenomena. The difference between magnetism and 
electricity was just an "angle of view." I suddenly realized that I was no longer just pursuing how. I 
began to ask why. I began to look back and pick up the basics and learn what I should have learned before. 
This process of return is painful. I hope you can wake up and never do such a foolish thing.
